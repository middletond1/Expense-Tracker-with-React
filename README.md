##### This app is a version of my original Expense Tracker built using React. As my first experience building with React, it was an exciting project that took some time to get into. In preparation for this project, I completed an 11-hour course on Scrimba to learn the basics of React. Having already built the app with vanilla JS, it was a good introduction to working with React, creating simple components, and understanding how to utilize state. This was also my first time using React-Bootstrap to style an app.
